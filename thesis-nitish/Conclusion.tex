\todo{Presented a NN architechture for learning distributed doc embeddings that tries to overcome issues in bow. Give a computationally inexpensive NCE objective rather than modelling distribution exactly. makes system parallel implementable. 
Present a modified logisitic regression algo to also embed cats in the same space. 
Show results on reuters 21758. achieve 91.7 F1. improves previous state of art by some percentage. }

\todo{Also present evaluations on imputing missing categories. }
