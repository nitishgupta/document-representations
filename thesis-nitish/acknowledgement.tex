I would first like to express my sincere gratitude towards my thesis supervisor, {\advisormain}, for his unparalleled guidance and support. I thank him for motivating me and guiding me in many more ways than just a supervisor. I am grateful for his patience and belief in me to pursue a research topic of my liking (that used to change every semester). I am also grateful to my co-supervisor, {\advisorsec}, for his invaluable suggestions from time to time and most importantly for giving me the freedom to work in the field of my choice.

I would like to thank my mentor and collaborator, Sameer Singh for developing in me a sound research temperament and teaching me how to ask the right questions to find the correct answers. 
My 5 year long stay at IIT Kanpur wouldn't have been the same without my bevy of friends, especially Deo, Pretesh, Pranjal, Mohit, Anubhav, Aryan, Utkarsh, Ladha, Anna and Mehgdeep, with whom I have shared some of the best years of my life. I am sure they enjoyed the laughs as much as I did.

\paragraph*{}
Lastly, thank you Maa, Papa and Bhaiya for you never ending love and encouragement. Thank you!
