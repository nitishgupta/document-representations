\end{center}
I wouldn't like to express my sincere gratitude towards my thesis supervisor, {\advisormain}, for his constant support and encouragement. I am grateful for his patient guidance and advice in giving a proper direction to my efforts. I am also grateful to {\advisorsec} for giving me the freedom to work on a topic of my liking.

\paragraph*{}
I am fortunate for the bevy of my friends I am a part of - I would like to thank them immensely, especially
Aditya, Abhinav, Shubhendu, Parul, Pranay, Arzoo, Saurabh, Prajyoti, Asheesh and Anjana for their pleasant company and their ability to infuse humor into any situation. I would particularly like to thank Shrutiranjan Satapathy for his constant support, invaluable discussions and needless coffee breaks. 

\paragraph*{}
Last, but not the least, I would like to thank my parents and brother for their love and encouragement. Without their support and patience this work would not have been possible.
