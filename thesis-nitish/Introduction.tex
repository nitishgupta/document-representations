para 4 : Here is where we come in. We present a model for document representations. Earlier cites have tried doing this. LSI is another dimensionality reduction technique. }

Multi-Label Document Categorization \emph{(also known as Text Categorization or Classification)} is the task of assigning one or more predefined categories to documents to provide a conceptual view of the document collection and describe the semantic content of a document. For example, an article on music piracy can be simultaneously classified into \emph{Arts/Music}, \emph{Internet/Security}, \emph{Laws/Cyber}.    
With the growth of online information, Document Categorization has found its use in many important real world applications ranging from document organization to information retrieval. It can be used to organize news stories by categories (topics), classify academic papers by the technical domains and sub-domains they belong to, cluster documents based on their semantic content for easy retrieval and recommendation etc.
With the advent of crowd-sourced databases such as Wikipedia\footnote{www.wikipedia.org} which contains over $4$ million documents that are manually categorized from a category set containing over $500$ thousand categories, automatic document categorization is utmost necessary and useful to assign categories to new articles that are being added daily and also assign missing categories to older documents.
