\end{center}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards my thesis supervisor {\advisor} for his constant support and encouragement. I am grateful for his patient guidance and advice in giving a proper direction to my efforts. 

\paragraph*{}
I am fortunate for the bevy of my friends I am a part of - I would like to thank them immensely, especially
Abhinav, Shubhendu, Parul, Pranay, Arzoo, Saurabh, Prajyoti, Asheesh and Anjana for their pleasant company and their ability to infuse humor into any situation. I would particularly like to thank Shrutiranjan Satapathy for his constant support, invaluable discussions and needless coffee breaks. 

\paragraph*{}
Last, but not the least, I would like to thank my parents and brother for their love and encouragement. Without their support and patience this work would not have been possible.
