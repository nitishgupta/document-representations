turing
During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius From September Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker Soon after the July Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba Two cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park Turing worked here in and before moving to Hut On September the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches which were entitled Report on the applications of probability to cryptography and Paper on statistics of repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April shortly before the centenary of his birth A GCHQ mathematician said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some years demonstrated their importance Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off His bicycle had a fault the chain would come off at regular intervals Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the miles km to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards Turing tried out for the British Olympic team hampered by an injury His tryout time for the marathon was only minutes slower than British silver medalist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of hours minutes He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone In Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years
